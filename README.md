# Web Unified Design Kit

This repo contains a backlog of items to add to Red Hat's XD design kit and Sketch library, shared by Red Hat’s digital marketing, customer platform, and product design teams.

Our goal is to unify Red Hat’s digital experiences with a shared design system based on [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/v4) 4 and informed by [Red Hat brand standards](https://brand.redhat.com).

## To use

Both files are WIP as we align the two design kits. 

- [XD design kit](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d20a1c17-375c-4c7f-6827-5fe2f8c2d92f-a43b/grid) and [Dev specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/3e62e93c-8338-4f31-5040-3b81f0ed5c71-4853/grid/)
- [PatternFly Web sketch library](https://sketch.cloud/s/jeKZz) and [demo file](https://sketch.cloud/s/3WK1w)
